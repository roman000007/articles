## “THE BORE-ING COMPANY”

[Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk), CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has been moving quickly on the development of what he calls “The Boring Company.” In January of last year, he presented a proposal at the Hyperloop Pod Competition for a company that would lighten traffic through the use of  underground tunnels. One year later, Musk mentioned that construction of a tunnel could begin in Los Angeles by the end of February.

Musk hasn’t fallen short of his promise – his new boring machine began to dig a tunnel as part of a demonstration at SpaceX’s Hyperloop Pod Competition last weekend. Although the machine has only created a mere hole, his team plans to eventually construct a full-fledged tunnel.

Musk hasn’t been too clear about how the tunnel will function, but the Hyperloop could be involved – after, it is supposed to be able to work above or below ground. Musk has, at the very least, not denied the connection:

For those that are curious enough to see what Musks’ boring machine looks like, he released a photo of it on Twitter recently. This might be only one part of a massive machine without the cutting head attached.

##### So Mr. Musk, are you thinking to combine Hyperloop and Tunnels to make transportation revolution.

## Teleportation Could Be Possible Using Quantum Physics
While being able to transport anything large, like a cat — the example the video uses — is a long way off, scientists have managed to transport a single photon or electron about 100km. The difficulty lies in creating two entangled sets of particles and subsequently transporting one of them without it becoming disentangled.

This is linked to scientists achieving direct counterfactual quantum communication for the first time recently, which operates using the Zeno effect (freezing the situation by observing it) rather than entanglement. In the experiment, scientists successfully transported information using the phase of light.

#### IN BRIEF
---
###### Quantum physics could, theoretically, be used to fulfil the age old desire to teleport. However, any practical use is a an extremely long way off, with scientists only managing single particles so far.

###### It`s really amazing!
